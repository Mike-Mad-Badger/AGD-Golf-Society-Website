		<h2>Autumn 2011 - Burhill Golf Club</h2>
		<p>Nigel Attwood cleaned up on a fine day at Burhill, winning more prizes than we could count. Seriously though, congratulations to Nigel on what was clearly a fine day of golf, contributing to his teams yellow ball success, blind pairs success and taking both the nearest the pin and overall championship trophy.</p>
		<p>Thanks also to our invited guests, it was great to have new faces and some great company by all reports.</p>
		<p>Other prize winners included the team yellow ball of Nigel, Jerry Burton, Duncan Clark and Peter Blackman; Paul Stevens partnered Nigel to the blind pairs trophy and Barry Griffiths walked away with the longest drive prize. We have yet to determine the front and back nine winners - watch this space!</p>
