	<h2>Spring 2009 Results</h2>
	<p>On the 18th May 16 intrepid golfers from Milton Hill set out to do battle with the Magnolia Park golf course in Oxfordshire. The day typified English spring time; we saw cracking sunshine, howling gales, sideways rain, hail showers and finally a warm, still, quiet, indeed balmy, evening. An 8:30 am start with bacon sandwiches and strong coffee was followed by 9 holes in teams of four.</p>
	<h3>Morning Results</h3>
	<h4>Yellow Ball Winners</h4>
	<p>Nigel Attwood, Duncan Clark, Iain More and Dave Roberts</p>
	<h4>Blind Pairs Winners</h4>
	<p>Andy Wraight and Mike Conroy surprised themselves as much as everyone else by walking away with this title</p>
	<h3>Afternoon Results</h3>
	<h4>Overall Winner</h4>
	<p>Mike Capaldi emerged victorious and became the inaugural winner of the Infineum AGD trophy after an excellent round of golf in very testing conditions</p>
	<p>Paul Wilson had the longest drive and Nigel Attwood lifted the nearest the pin trophy.</p>
	<h4>Notable Mentions</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>18 holes of hard golf followed and much time was spent hunting for lost golf balls</li>
		<li>One member of the party overcame this challenge on a particularly difficult hole by avoiding hitting the ball any further than 10yds with each shot!</li>
	</ul>
