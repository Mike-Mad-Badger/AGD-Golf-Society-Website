	<h2>Spring 2010 Results</h2>
	<p>Another fine day of golf, started by Rob dispensing with the yellow ball on the first shot of the first hole and finished by Pete Mc targetting the clubhouse (and the rest of us) from 50yds with his deadly wedge play! You can get the full results in <a href="media/pdf/spring_2010.pdf">this pdf</a> file, there's a summary below.</p>

	<h4>Notable Mentions</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>After a poor 13 points in the morning a good lunch and a pint of Guinness appeared to do wonders for Mike Conroy's golf in the afternoon - it really is wonderful stuff that Guiness!</li>
		<li>Andy Wraight and Nigel Attwood were the bookies favourites after 9 holes with 22 and 20 points but faded on the back nine with only 10 points each</li>
		<li>Andy also knocked up 2 birdies (gross) and 2 eagles (net)</li>
		<li>Iain More was best on the back nine with 17 points, maybe he relaxed after scoring 10 on the front nine?</li>
	</ul>
